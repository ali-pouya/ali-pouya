# 👋 Hi, I'm Ali Pouya

Optical engineer building tools for imaging simulation, optical metrology, and automated testing.  
> 📌 *I'm currently consolidating years of optics and imaging work into a unified public GitHub page.*

### 🔭 Featured Work

- **[Imaging Pipeline Simulator](https://github.com/ali-pouya/IMAGING-PIPELINE-SIM)**  
  Modular scene → optics → sensor simulator for visualizing blur, PSF, pixel MTF, and end-to-end imaging behavior.
- **[Camera MTF Bench](https://github.com/ali-pouya/CAMERA-MTF-BENCH)**  
  Automated slanted-edge MTF + autofocus bench using Python, OpenCV, and PyVISA, with Siemens targets and contrast metrics.
- **Optics Learning Hub** *(coming soon)*  
  Hands-on optics & imaging lessons built with Jupyter-Book.
